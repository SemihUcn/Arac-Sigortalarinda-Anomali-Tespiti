## 🔍 Overview

**SemihUcn-Ara-Sigortalarında-Anomali-Tespiti** is a robust machine learning pipeline that performs **binary classification** to detect fraudulent insurance claims. The project includes advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation tailored to imbalanced datasets.

### 🎯 Why Use This Project?

This toolkit helps data scientists and insurance analysts to:

- 🧹 **Prepare Data**: Clean, encode, and select relevant features for high-quality model inputs.
- ⚖️ **Handle Imbalanced Classes**: Apply techniques like SMOTE and random undersampling to balance the dataset.
- 🧠 **Train Classifiers**: Fit and compare multiple machine learning models with a focus on classifiers like XGBoost.
- 📊 **Evaluate Models**: Use metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-score, precision-recall, and confusion matrix with visual support.
- 📈 **Optimize Performance**: Tune hyperparameters to improve generalization and accuracy on real-world data.
